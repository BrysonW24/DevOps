1. SageMaker Proof of Concept:

• Objective: Deploy a machine learning model on AWS SageMaker.

Step 1: Choose a Model:
• Start with a simple model, like a linear regression or a pre-built model from SageMaker’s example notebooks.

Step 2: Prepare Data:
• Use a sample dataset from AWS (e.g., the built-in datasets or your own). Store it in an S3 bucket.

Step 3: Set Up SageMaker:
• In the AWS Console, navigate to SageMaker and create a notebook instance.
• Open JupyterLab and prepare your code to train the model using your dataset.

Step 4: Train the Model:
• Use the notebook to train your model. Depending on your use case, this might involve a simple regression task or something more complex like image classification.

Step 5: Deploy and Test:
• Deploy the model as a SageMaker endpoint.
• Test it by sending real or test data to the endpoint for predictions.
