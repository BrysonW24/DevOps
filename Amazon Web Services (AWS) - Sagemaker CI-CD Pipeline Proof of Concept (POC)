Project Overview:
This POC demonstrates the automated deployment of a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker integrated with CI/CD pipelines. The pipeline will automatically retrain and redeploy a model based on new data or code changes.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Set Up Your AWS Environment
•	Create an AWS Account (if you don't already have one).
•	Set up an IAM role with appropriate permissions for SageMaker, S3, and AWS CodePipeline:
o	Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management) and create a role with policies like AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, and AWSCodePipelineFullAccess.
o	Attach this role to your SageMaker notebook instances.


2. Prepare Your Machine Learning Model
•	Choose a pre-trained model or build a simple model for demonstration purposes (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
•	Write your model training script in Python using popular frameworks like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
o	Example script: Train a logistic regression model on the Iris dataset (available in most ML libraries).
python
Copy code
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import joblib

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')
•	Upload the training script to your Amazon S3 bucket (e.g., s3://your-bucket/training/model_train.py).


3. Create a SageMaker Training Job
•	In SageMaker, create a new training job:
o	Specify the S3 bucket location of your model training script and data.
o	Select a training instance type (e.g., ml.m4.xlarge).
o	Specify the output location (another S3 bucket) for your trained model artifacts.
•	After training completes, deploy the model directly in SageMaker or store the model artifact in S3.

4. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline
•	Create a CodeCommit repository (or use GitHub) to store your training code:
o	Commit your model training script (model_train.py) and necessary dependencies (e.g., requirements.txt).
•	Create a CodePipeline that triggers model retraining:
o	Source Stage: Use CodeCommit or GitHub as the source to trigger the pipeline when new code is pushed.
o	Build Stage: Use AWS CodeBuild to install dependencies and execute the training script:
Example buildspec.yml for CodeBuild:
yaml
Copy code
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  build:
    commands:
      - python model_train.py
      - aws s3 cp model.joblib s3://your-bucket/trained-model/
artifacts:
  files:
    - model.joblib
  discard-paths: yes
•	Deploy Stage: Set up AWS Lambda or SageMaker for automated deployment.
o	Create a Lambda function that deploys the model using SageMaker or directly automate it through CodePipeline by invoking SageMaker's deployment API.
5. Automate Model Deployment in SageMaker
•	After retraining, automate the deployment using AWS Lambda or SageMaker Endpoint:
o	Create a Lambda function that deploys the new model version to SageMaker.
o	Alternatively, use SageMaker’s Boto3 API to update the model endpoint.
Example:
python
Copy code
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = sagemaker.create_endpoint(
    EndpointName='your-model-endpoint',
    EndpointConfigName='your-endpoint-config'
)

6. Monitoring and Logging with CloudWatch
•	Set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor model performance and resource usage:
o	Track metrics such as latency, throughput, and model performance (e.g., F1-score, accuracy).
•	Implement CloudWatch Alarms to notify you when the model performance drops below a certain threshold or if deployment fails.
7. Test and Validate
•	After deploying the model, test the endpoint using a SageMaker Notebook or by invoking the API using boto3 in Python.
•	Validate the retraining by changing the code in CodeCommit or GitHub to see if the pipeline automatically triggers retraining and deployment.
8. (Optional) Add Hyperparameter Tuning
•	If needed, add SageMaker's Hyperparameter Tuning to automatically find the best parameters for your model during training.
•	Use SageMaker Tuner to define the search space for your model's hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and include it in the CI/CD pipeline for optimization.
9. Documentation and Presentation
•	Document each stage of the POC for future reference or presentation.
•	Consider adding API documentation to describe how external applications can interact with the deployed model.
•	Present the full lifecycle of the ML model from training to deployment and monitoring using AWS services.

Example Workflow Diagram:
1.	Code is pushed to CodeCommit.
2.	CodePipeline triggers CodeBuild to retrain the model using the latest data.
3.	Trained model is stored in S3.
4.	AWS Lambda or SageMaker automates the deployment to a live SageMaker Endpoint.
5.	Model performance is monitored using CloudWatch.
