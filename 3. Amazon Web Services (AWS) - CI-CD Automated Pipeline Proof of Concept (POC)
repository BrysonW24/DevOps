3. CI/CD Automated Pipeline:

• Objective: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate code deployment.

Step 1: Choose a CI/CD Tool:
• Use AWS CodePipeline for the pipeline setup.

Step 2: Set Up Source Control:
• Use AWS CodeCommit or GitHub to store your source code (e.g., the CloudFormation template or SageMaker code).

Step 3: Create a Pipeline:
• Go to AWS CodePipeline and create a new pipeline.
• Configure the source stage to pull from your repository (CodeCommit or GitHub) whenever changes are pushed.

Step 4: Build Stage (Optional):
• Add AWS CodeBuild to compile or test your code (if needed).
• If you’re using CloudFormation or SageMaker, this step may not be necessary unless you’re doing code compilation or pre-deployment testing.

Step 5: Deploy Stage:
• Configure CodePipeline to use AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure deployment or SageMaker for model deployment.
• Ensure that any code changes in the repository trigger an automatic deployment to the target environment.

Step 6: Notifications (Optional):
• Set up SNS or email notifications to alert you of pipeline successes or failures.

Step 7: Testing & Validation:
• Test the pipeline by pushing changes to the repository and monitoring the automated deployment.
• Confirm that your infrastructure or models are deployed as expected.
