2. CloudFormation Proof of Concept:

• Objective: Create a simple infrastructure setup using AWS CloudFormation.

Step 1: Write a CloudFormation Template:
• Define a basic infrastructure (e.g., an S3 bucket, EC2 instance) in YAML or JSON format.
• Example:
Resources:
MyS3Bucket:
Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
Properties:
BucketName: 'my-sample-bucket'

Step 2: Upload to CloudFormation:
• Go to the AWS CloudFormation console, click “Create Stack,” and upload your template.

Step 3: Launch the Stack:
• Follow the steps in the console to launch the CloudFormation stack.
• Monitor the process and troubleshoot if there are any issues during deployment.

Step 4: Verify Resources:
• After the stack is created, check the AWS resources (S3 bucket, EC2 instance, etc.) to ensure they were created correctly.
